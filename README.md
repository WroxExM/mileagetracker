This system is a fully modular and scalable Vehicle Mileage Tracking System built specifically for SA-MP servers aiming for realism and persistent vehicle data management. Designed with performance and accuracy in mind, the system calculates real-time mileage using 3D positional updates and stores the data efficiently via MySQL. It supports owner-linked vehicles, auto-updates at defined intervals, and includes a clean, informative /vmileage command to display distance traveled per vehicle. Built with extensibility in mind, this project can serve as a base for advanced features like fuel consumption, maintenance cost systems, rental logs, or fleet monitoring. Clean code structure and SQL-safe queries ensure the system is production-ready for professional roleplay or freeroam servers.
